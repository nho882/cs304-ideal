      <h4> Our Mission </h4>
      We aim to provide peeks into the lives of employees at companies, primarily their experiences as related to their identities, marginalized or not. We are a socially conscious platform that hosts reviews with a goal of transforming the workplace. IDeal is a site aimed at equipping job seekers with important information regarding their potential employer.

      <h4> Where IDeal Began </h4>
      The idea of IDeal originated from WHACK Fall '17 by a team composed of Justin Ferrill, Dana Frayne, Nancy Ho, Pet Ramanudom, and Jacqueline Young. For their final project for CS304, Nancy and Pet decided to expand upon IDeal.
